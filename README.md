# Harness the attacks of the Warden with Echo Weapons!

The Warden will now drop its heart, which will allow you to upgrade your netherite and ranged weapons with its powers, creating Echo Weapons.

### Features

- Warden Heart: Dropped from the Warden upon death. When combined with a weapon and an echo shard in a smithing table, it upgrades the weapon to Echo tier.
- Echo Sword/Axe: An upgrade from the netherite counterpart, dealing more damage and having the chance to inflict knockback and the darkness effect on those attacked.
- Echo Bow/Crossbow: When shot, this weapon will perform the Warden's sonic boom attack, piercing through several mobs and dealing significant damage.
- Sculk Dust and Arrows: Gather sculk dust by mining sculk blocks, and upgrade regular arrows with 4 sculk dust in order to make them usable with the Echo Bow and Echo Crossbow.
